# File Sync Server

- This is going to be part of my File Sync Application, which is a resemblence of command-line 'Dropbox'. I am also practicing C++ here, so the application will evolve over time.
- I am going through [Learn CPP](learncpp.com) here, and this repository is going to be partly the practice sandbox for it. 

## Learn GDB
